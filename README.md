# gtt_topos_of_trees
Research internship project at Radboud University for the master's programme "Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science".

I give an introduction to the topos of trees as a model of step-indexing and guarded recursion, and investigate sound logical reasoning rules in the internal logic of the topos of trees. In particular, we present a novel axiom for step-indexed logics for commuting quantifiers with the later modality. We provide a Coq formalization of the topos of trees and a shallow embedding of its internal logic.
